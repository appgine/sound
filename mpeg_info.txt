MAX MPEG frame size
https://www.mars.org/pipermail/mad-dev/2002-January/000425.html

The absolute theoretical maximum frame size is 2881 bytes: MPEG 2.5 Layer II,
8000 Hz @ 160 kbps, with a padding slot. (Such a frame is unlikely, but it was
a useful exercise to compute all possible frame sizes.) Add to this an 8 byte
MAD_BUFFER_GUARD, and the minimum buffer size you should be streaming to
libmad in the general case is 2889 bytes.

Theoretical frame sizes for Layer III range from 24 to 1441 bytes, but there
is a "soft" limit imposed by the standard of 960 bytes. Nonetheless MAD can
decode frames of any size as long as they fit entirely in the buffer you pass,
not including the MAD_BUFFER_GUARD bytes.
